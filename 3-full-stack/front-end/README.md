# Front-End Standalone
This application uses React and Redux Toolkit to make a fully functioning Blog app that can run locally on your machine.

## Practice
Challenge yourself by trying to create your own front-end application from scratch.

- Create module folder structure
- Design your data structures
- Create the router with stubbed pages
- Create Redux Toolkit slices for your data
- Create your other components and connect them to your Redux data store.
