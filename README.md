# Hands-On Full-Stack React

Welcome to the Repository for the Hands-On Full-Stack React class! I have broken the project into progress steps.

## Week 1
In this lesson we will create a full-stack application locally on our machines. We will go through folders 1 through 3.

- [1-front-end-standalone](/1-front-end-standalone) - Create a working front-end application.
- [2-back-end-no-db](/2-back-end-no-db) - Create a working back-end without a database. Test with Postman.
- [3-full-stack](/3-full-stack) - Create a MongoDB and tie all the pieces together.

### Week 1 Assignment
Using React, Redux Toolkit, ExpressJS, and Mongodb, create a full-stack application locally on your machine.

For help, reference the repository. You are also encouraged to use other resources whenever needed!

## Week 2
In this lesson we will deploy our application to EC2, then we will make our API scalable using Lambdas, API Gateway, and AWS Amplify, and finally we will deploy the front-end to Netlify.

- [3-full-stack](3-full-stack) - Prepare application to run in EC2
- [3-full-stack/RUN_ON_EC2.md](3-full-stack/RUN_ON_EC2.md) - Deploy application to EC2
- [4-full-stack-lambdas/LAMBDA_API.md](4-full-stack-lambdas/LAMBDA_API.md) - Deploy API to Lambdas for scalability
- [4-full-stack-lambdas/NETLIFY_HOSTING.md](4-full-stack-lambdas/NETLIFY_HOSTING.md) - Deploy front-end to Netlify

## Week 3
Week 3 information will be added before the third lesson.
